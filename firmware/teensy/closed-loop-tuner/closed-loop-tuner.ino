/*
 * autonomous-tuner-firmware
 * 
 * Runs the core functionality for the robotic violin tuner. The device recieves commands over serial
 * which are used to initialize the device and control the setpoint. The commands are also used to
 * retrieve critical information such as pitch telemetry and system state. Details on the valid commands
 * can be found in the 'd_Commands' tab and are all of the format: 
 *                                  [COMMAND ID],{OPR1},{OPR2},â€¦,{OPRn};
 *                                  
 * This program is designed to work with the MP6500 Stepper Motor Driver, but can be easily modified to use others.
 * 
 * Circuit:
 *  On the MP6500
 *  enable -> 39
 *  MS1    -> 38
 *  MS2    -> 37
 * 
 *  Audio:
 *  Output of Amp -> A2
 * 
 *  If Using Hardware Serial:
 *  Pin 0 is RX
 *  Pin 1 is TX
 * 
 * This firmware was written to run on a Teensy 3.5 Microcontroller, but should work on any Teensy 3.x variant.
 * 
 * Initial Release 27 May 2019
