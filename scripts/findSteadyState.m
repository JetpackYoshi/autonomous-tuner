function [steadystate_mean, steadystate_index] = findSteadyState(dataX, Tsteadystate, Sstep, SampleTime, std_crit, deltaX, lowerBoundery, upperBoundery)
% 
% FINDSTEADYSTATE, finds periods of steady state within a data-set.
% 
% this function goes through a data-set (1) with defined steps (3) from the
% end of the data-set to the beginning. the standard deviation (std) within
% a defined time period (2) is compared with a defined maximum std (5), if
% the calculated std is smaller than the average it is stored together with
% the start time of the steady state period. in order to make this function
% more effective also the minimum difference between the average calculated
% from the steady state period has to be included (6). optionally the lower
% and upper bounderies (7 & 8) can be given to exclude noise.
% 
% this function gives the following output:
%   *the average of the steady state periods (steadystate_mean)
%   *the start index of the steady state period (steadystate_index)
%
% this function handles the following input:
%   1*dataX: vector with data for analysis
%   2*Tsteadystate (s): length of steady state period
%   3*Sstep (s): length of steps for analysis dataX
%   4*SampleTime (s): the sample time
%   5*std_crit: the minimal allowed standard deviation within a steady
%     state period
%   6*deltaX: the minimal allowed difference between the average of two
%     concecutive steady state periods
%   7*lowerBoundery (optional): smaller or equal values in dataX defined by
%     lowerBoundery will be ignored
%   8*upperBoundery (optional): larger or equal values in dataX defined by
%     upperBoundery will be ignored

%% version information
% version 1.0: first running version
% version 1.1: in this version an lower and upper bounderies are taken into
% consideration. This was needed since data sometimes shows spikes, 
% distorbing the function of this function
% version 1.2: 'flipud' is used instead of a inversion loop
